Block Chain Document
------------------------

Some time before, there is a timetable from different companies on the internet. It's open and well maintained. But the data is growing fast, and the size is too large to be an online document. Sometimes, it could be tampered by someone. So we need some tool to prevent unexpected tampering and more convenient.

I introduce the block chain document. In fact, it's just my personal interest. I don't konw how long it will take and even whether it could be finished. I decide to create a demo with python, if it works, i will convert it to go or rust.
